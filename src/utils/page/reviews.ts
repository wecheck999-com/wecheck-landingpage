      "I genuinely really love GoDatingFi compared to other dating apps because you are free to express yourself your true self and true identity. They will not shadow ban you, take down your profile or take down your photos compared to other dating apps I’ve tried. Some dating apps would delete my profile if you upload a picture they don’t allow and no communication from the support team …of course be compliant with the community guidelines. I meant more as if you wanted to express yourself by uploading a picture of your cool mask due to the world's pandemic I want to be able to be allowed to upload it and some dating apps would take down my pictures… GoDatingFi DOES let me express myself on there. As well You get recognition and, swiping is perfect and easy! If you are there for friends, friends are exactly what you will get or if you’re there for a relationship it’s an AWESOME way to find someone. You don’t necessarily need to purchase anything to get swipes I ABSOLUTELY love that!!!",

      'I was starting to get tired of having this app because I would end up having guys already inviting me over to their house or just dtf. But that was until I met someone different, during our first conversation I went out of my way and called him. We had a good long conversation. So the next day he had asked if I would like to hang out and I said yes. So after meeting up and hanging out on a weekend. I would say our first date was a success! Initially, I downloaded this to make new connections. But after having a third date with the guy, he had asked me out. Of course, I said because I really was into his personality! So thanks to GoDatingFi, I got to meet my boyfriend.',

      "I tend to have better experiences with this app when I'm traveling, as opposed to when I'm at home. It's probably to do with population centers being larger and more diverse around airports than anything else. But like all things, it seems to work best when you put a little bit of time to it on a regular basis, as opposed to a large binge on sporadic intervals. Hope to see more innovations soon!",

      "The best dating app I've used so far. Cons: - You can't swipe in other countries unless you click on the location tab on the bottom left. Even with that, your options are very limited - Paying for little features such as seeing if your messages have been seen and crushes Pros: - The premium services are pricey but definitely worth getting since it really does help your chances for matches - Quality matches with quality women! But some locations are better than others. Just gotta find them!",
